# ABSTRACT

This application uses two types of TRNGs - True Random Number Generators (TrueRNG and Bitbbabler)
for data collection and statistical analysis for several purposes, including mind-matter interaction research.


# Supported Hardware:

1- TrueRNG and TrueRNGPro (https://ubld.it/);  
2- Bitbabbler Black and White (http://www.bitbabbler.org/what.html).

# Installation

1- Hardware Installation:
    The default installation path is: "C:\Users\Username\RngKit" - Where Username is the name of the windows current user.  
    1.1- TrueRNG e TrueRNGPro:  
         Choose from the 2-Installation folder (inside the "C:\Users\Username\RngKit") the TrueRng folder, the folder for your device (TrueRng3 or TrueRngPro)
         Within this folder, right-click the TrueRNG.inf or TrueRNGpro.inf file and select Install. Follow the instructions for installation.  
    1.2- Bitbabbler:  
         Inside the 2-Installation\BitBabbler folder (inside the "C:\Users\Username\RngKit"), run vcredist_x64.exe (source: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679) and follow the installation guidelines.
         Insert your bitbabbler device into a USB port and run the zadig-2.4.exe file (source: http://zadig.akeo.ie/). Select your device and click "Install WCDI Driver".
         Wait for the process to finish and close the program.

# Usage

1- Start the program;  
2- The program has 3 tabs:
- TAB 1: The first tab is for analysis and collecting data:
> Collecting:
To collect data, select the device to use, or multiple devices and click "Start". You can set the sample size (in bits) and the sample interval (in seconds). 
BitBabbler has different capturing options (number of folds), with option 0 being in RAW, options between 1 and 4 in XOR, TrueRNG only works in XOR mode.
Hit "Stop" when you wish to stop the process. Two files are going to be created inside the "1-SavedFiles" folder. One with .bin extension and another with .csv.
The .bin is in binary form and is used as a controller. The .csv contains more info, like the time of each collected series, usually will be better to analyse the .csv file.
> Analysing:
To analyse the file and generate a Excel file with z-score and a graph, select a previously generated .bin or .csv file whit the "Browse" button.
Also, be sure the select the correct value for the sample size and sample interval, or you will get wrong result.
Clicking "Generate" will automatically generate a file with the same name as the one selected, but with extension .xlsx, with the analyzed data.
This file will be saved in the "1-SavedFiles" folder. You can click "Open Output Folder" to open Windows Explorer at the file location.

- TAB 2: The second tab is for collecting and presenting a live Zscore x Time chart.
Select the device to use (BitBabbler can be set to 0 (RAW) or 1 (XOR)).
Click on "Start", the chart will update and at the same time two files will be generated and saved (.bin and .csv).
When you finish capturing it is important to click "Stop".

- TAB 3: Instructions Tab

3- File naming:  
The file name contains important information about the collected data.
The first part is the date and time of the collection, then the device used (trng for TrueRN or bitb for Bitbabbler), the number of bits per sample, the time between each sample in seconds and finally, only on Bitbabbler devices, whether in RAW or in XOR (number of folds).
For example "20201011-142208_bitb_s2048_i1_f0": Collected on November 11, 2020, at 14:22:08, Bitbbabler device, sample of 2048 bits every 1 second, RAW mode (fold 0).
